CREATE TABLE Orders (OrderID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, ClientID VARCHAR(10), ProductID VARCHAR(10), Quantity INT, Cost DECIMAL(6, 2));

INSERT INTO Orders (OrderID, ClientID, ProductID, Quantity, Cost) VALUES (1, "Cl1", "P1", 10, 500), (2, "Cl2", "P2", 5, 100), (3, "Cl3", "P3", 20, 800), (4, "Cl4", "P4", 15, 150), (5, "Cl3", "P3", 10, 450), (6, "Cl2", "P2", 5, 800), (7, "Cl1", "P4", 22, 1200), (8, "Cl1", "P1", 15, 150);

#Task 1: Write a SQL statement to create the OrdersView Virtual table based on the Orders table. The table must include the following columns: Order ID, Quantity and Cost. Once you have executed the query, select all data from the OrdersView table. 
SELECT * FROM orders;
CREATE VIEW OrdersView AS SELECT OrderID, Quantity, Cost FROM orders;
SELECT * FROM OrdersView;

#Task 2: Write a SQL statement that utilizes the ‘OrdersView’ virtual table to Update the base Orders table. In the UPDATE TABLE statement, change the cost to 200 where the order id equals 2. Once you have executed the query, select all data from the OrdersView table. 
UPDATE OrdersView SET Cost = 200 WHERE OrderID = 2; 
SELECT * FROM OrdersView;
SELECT * FROM orders;

-- Task 3: Write a SQL statement that changes the name of the ‘OrdersView’ virtual table to ClientsOrdersView.
RENAME TABLE OrdersView TO ClientsOrdersView;

-- Task 4: Write a SQL statement to delete the Orders virtual table.
DROP VIEW ClientsOrdersView;
