-- Task 1: Find the minimum and the maximum average prices at which the customers can purchase food and drinks.
-- Hint: In this task, you must write subqueries using the FROM clause. Your subquery would find the average prices of menu items by their type. The subquery result will be the input for the outer query to find the minimum and maximum average prices.
SELECT * FROM MenuItems;

SELECT ROUND(MIN(AvgPrice),2), ROUND(MAX(AvgPrice),2) FROM (SELECT Type, AVG(Price) as AvgPrice FROM MenuItems GROUP BY Type) AS AvgPriceTable;

-- Task 2: Insert data of menu items with a minimum price based on the 'Type' into the LowCostMenuItems table.
-- Hint: In this task, you must write subqueries in INSERT statements. Your subquery would find the details of menu items with a minimum price based on the 'Type' of menu item. In other words, GROUP BY Type. Then you can insert the data retrieved from the subquery into the LowCostMenuItems table using an INSERT INTO SELECT statement.LowCostMenuItems
INSERT INTO LowCostMenuItems SELECT ItemID, Name, Price FROM MenuItems WHERE Price = ANY(SELECT MIN(Price) FROM MenuItems GROUP BY Type);
SELECT * FROM LowCostMenuItems;

-- Task 3: Delete all the low-cost menu items whose price is more than the minimum price of menu items that have a price between $5 and $10.
-- Hint: You need to write subqueries in DELETE statements in this task. Your subquery will be placed in the WHERE clause of the DELETE statement to find the minimum prices of menu items that have a price between $5 and $10. Use the ALL operator in the outer query to find matches from the values returned from the subquery. Delete those records with matching prices from the LowCostMenuItems table.
-- SELECT MIN(Price) as p FROM MenuItems GROUP BY Type HAVING p BETWEEN 5 AND 10;
DELETE FROM LowCostMenuItems 
WHERE Price > ALL(SELECT MIN(Price) as p FROM MenuItems GROUP BY Type HAVING p BETWEEN 5 AND 10);
